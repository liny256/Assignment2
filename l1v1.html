    <h1>Spring and Fall</h1>
    <h4>By Gerard Manley Hopkins</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Margaret, are you grieving
      <br>
       Over Goldengrove unleaving?
      <br>
      <br>
       Leaves, like the things of man, you
      <br>
       With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
      <br>
      <br>
       Ah! as the heart grows older
      <br>
       It will come to such sights colder
      <br>
      <br>
       By & by, nor spare a sigh
      <br>
       Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
      <br>
      <br>
       And yet you w√≠ll weep & know why.
      <br>
       Now no matter, child, the name:
      <br>
      <br>
       Sorrow's springs are the same.
      <br>
       Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
      <br>
      <br>
       What heart heard of, ghost guessed:
      <br>
        <div class="border" id="one">
          <div class="whitering"id="ring1">
            <div class="whitering"id="ring2">
              <div class="goback"id="rosy">
                <div id="link">
                  <a href="index.html">Go Back</a>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

          </div>
          It is the blight man was born for,
          <br>
          <br>
           It is Margaret you mourn for.
        </div>
</p>
